# Replication Package for comparing paid and volunteer developers in Rust

This repository contains all the necessary data and code to reproduce our study, i.e., Contributions, Collaborations, and Transitions: Paid and Volunteer Developers in the Rust Community.

We have two main folders, code and data. In the two folders, you can find the required data and code for the five explored research questions.
To ensure the code's correct operation, please install the necessary dependencies, which are listed at the top of each code file.

Due to space limitations, we cannot upload the big commit dataset to this repository. If you have a need, please contact: yuxiazh@bit[dot]edu[dot]cn
